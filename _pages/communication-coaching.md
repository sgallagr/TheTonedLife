      <i>“I progressed more in 2 coaching sessions with Cathleen, than I did in 2 decades of counseling with my therapists. Cathleen systematically encouraged me to go farther than I ever could’ve imagined. Her knowledge on how the mind works, psychology, and communication is mind-blowing. Her approach and coaching on active forgiveness, self-talk, mindful communication, making peace with your past, etc have so greatly impacted my entire life in amazing ways. Do yourself a big favor and move forward with Cathleen as your coach instead of sitting still sharing the same old negative stories with your therapist.”</i> Jane G.<br><br>
      <b>For Business Professionals</b><br>
      <i>“Cathleen is highly organized, professional and knows communication. She helped my professional and personal image more than any book or seminar ever could.”</i> Bob K<br><br>
