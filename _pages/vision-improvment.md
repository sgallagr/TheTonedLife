Natural Vision Coaching for Your Eyes

Are you ready to ditch your glasses or contacts? Have you always wished you could see clearly and far away without glasses or contacts? As you age, would you like to read your favorite books, your phone, your car dashboard without “readers” or bifocals? Cathleen can show you how to get there.

Come experience relaxation for your eyes, as well as your mind and even your entire body. As a Bates Method Certified Natural Vision Coach, I teach individuals to experience naturally improved eyesight in a fun and personable way.

<i>“Cathleen is a master at guided visualizations – somehow she takes me on the most amazingly scenic vacations while my eyes are closed and resting during ‘palming’, and she’s kind enough to record these on my phone so I can listen to them everyday. I get a vacation for my mind and relaxation for my eyes and body. And when I open my eyes, it’s simply amazing how much better my vision is. This is the most fun and relaxing way to improve my eyesight! And she is such a sweet and helpful soul. She’s like a best friend who helps me see better”</i> <br>- JoAnn C.
